    <h3>A new Canadian from Kyiv, Ukraine</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs text-center">
      <p>Hello! I'm Julia, born in 1994 in Ukraine, just 100 km away from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. I have a passion for science fiction and horror, particularly the works of Stephen King, whose storytelling I find captivating and thought-provoking. While I'm not a fan of comedies or melodramas, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. Embroidery and knitting are my favorites because they are relaxing and rewarding. I also like experimenting with new recipes when cooking and occasionally practice yoga following videos on YouTube, which helps me stay active and maintain mental well-being. <br />

        My husband and I have been married since 2016, and we live in a cozy basement apartment with our beloved cat. We don't own a car, so I typically use the bus, but we rent cars for special occasions and trips. In my free time, I am currently refreshing my cybersecurity skills, as I hold a bachelor's degree in this field. This summer, I was supposed to study programming, but the course was postponed due to technical reasons.</p>
